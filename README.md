## About the project

<p align="justify"> 
  During my last year of training in computer design and development, we had to present a free project. 
I decided to go for a soccer website, providing news and matches results. Being a soccer fan myself, I wanted to work on a project that animates me and find new visuals.

You can see the evolution of the project via Figma. The drafts contain:
  * Mock-ups of the first version (presented at school)
  * Mock-ups of the second version (developed in my spare time after getting my degree)
  * Designs (icons, logos, moodboard...)
  * Presentation support, containing some diagrams (in its first version)
